# David Krentzlin

**I learn what is needed, when it's needed, to fill the roles I'm in - and I do it fast**. 

With roughly 18 years in the field I eat, sleep, and breathe code. I know how to approach
complex systems and build components that meet todayâ€™s demands. I've been in the position of a leader a follower alike and I am comfortable switching
both hats.

In the end it's mostly about people, communication, and relations - occasionally about technology. 


## Projects

All of the projects I have on github are for my personal educational purposes. That's the usual disclaimer to say, that they're in development
and even though I try to keep the main branch functional at all times, it may contain code that's incomplete or wrong.

I'm currently actively working mostly on the following projects:

* **[braces](https://github.com/certainty/braces)** *a scheme compiler and virtual machine written in Rust*
* **[r2d2](https://github.com/certainty/r2d2)** *a key-value store written in rust to explore LSMs and distributed storage systems*
* **[GraphQShell](https://github.com/certainty/graphqshell)** *a textual GraphQL client and explorer written in Haskell*

## Professional

I'm currently leading a team of architects and software engineers at New Work SE, where we build and operate the GraphQL Gateway, which
powers our products. We're crafting tools and services for our product engineers and try to make their lives easier, which is a great area to work in.
